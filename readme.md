# CSCI-GA 2433 Final Project

## Description:
In this part, we will create an interactive system to connect to MySQL through Python to interact with the database.

The interactive system includes show tables, select tables, update(insert, delete, and update) the data. 
In addiction, this interactive system also include the code from project3(Machine Learning part). 

We expect we could use the machine learning part to predict medical insurance price, and insert the price into the table.
We use python (in the jupyter notebook) to calculate the weight of the [Medical Insurance Premium Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/medical-insurance-premium-prediction) data, and export the weights into Python to predict the price.
