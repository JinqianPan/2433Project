# CSCI-GA 2433 Project (Software Portion)

## Description:
The project is about creating a database and interactive system for an insurance company. 

The project's first two parts are creating ER diagram and schema for the database. The third part of the project is finding a dataset that could help the insurance company and do the machine learning for this dataset. Finally, we need to finish the interactive system for the database.

This GitHub includes the software portion of part 3 and the final part.
